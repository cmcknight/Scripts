Scripts - A Collection of Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I've written for my own convenince and that may be useful to others (or not). Many require root access, so be careful when you use them. Read the contents of the script first so that you can avoid accidently bricking your system. In any case, the author assumes no responsibility nor liability past taking up space on your storage system.

Suggestions, improvements, corrections, are all gratefully accepted.
